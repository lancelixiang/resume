I am Lance, from Shaoyang, Hunan. I am currently a graduate student and will graduate next month. I worked for 13 years before enrollment and have two years of overseas work experience. I graduated from the School of Computer and Electronic Information at Guangxi University in 2009 and went to Shenzhen after graduation. I worked as a full stack developer in Shenzhen. In 2012, I went on a one-year business trip to Yemen. In 2013, I returned to Changsha where I mainly worked on front-end development, including JQuery, React, VUE, mini programs, H5, and mobile apps. In 2016, I went on a one-year business trip to the Philippines. My previous job was working as a front-end developer in a French funded foreign company, mainly responsible for creating WeChat mini programs and server-side rendering websites. Before enrollment, I was a senior front-end development engineer. In 2022, I entered the School of Intelligent Engineering and Intelligent Manufacturing at Hunan Technology and Business University to study electronic information. My research direction was medical image analysis and processing. During this period, I published one software work and won the provincial third and national second prizes in mathematical modeling competitions. I hope to find a job in front-end development or AI related fields.
